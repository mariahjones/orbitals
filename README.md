### Description:
At least three Solar System planets (Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune) have stable co-orbital asteroids that have shared the same orbit with the planet since the system's early days. We also know that Saturn and Uranus cannot have co-orbital asteroids because these planets are close to orbital resonances with Jupiter and Neptune, respectively. For example, proximity of Saturn to exact 5:2 period ratio with Jupiter makes Jupiter's gravitational perturbations on Saturn's potential co-orbitals very strong, and drives them out of stable configuration. Many known extrasolar planets are in tightly packed systems in which period ratios are close to, but not equal to, simple fractions required for existence of an orbital resonance. In this project we would use numerical simulations to explore how a planet's residence in a crowded, near-resonant system affects the stability of its potential co-orbital companions. If stable, such co-orbital bodies could in principle be observed during transits, either because the companion is itself planet-sized, or is a source of a large dust cloud.
